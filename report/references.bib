abstract = {In this paper we describe simple identification and signature schemes which enable any user to prove his identity and the authenticity of his messages to any other user without shared or public keys. The schemes are provably secure against any known or chosen message attack if factoring is difficult, and typical implementations require only 1\% to 4\% of the number of modular multiplications required by the RSA scheme. Due to their simplicity, security and speed, these schemes are ideally suited for microprocessor-based devices such as smart cards, personal computers, and remote control systems.},

abstract = {We argue that the random oracle model—where all parties have access to a public random oracle—provides a bridge between cryptographic theory and cryptographic practice. In the paradigm we suggest, a practical protocol P is produced by first devising and proving correct a protocol PR for the random oracle model, and then replacing oracle accesses by the computation of an “appropriately chosen” function h. This paradigm yields protocols much more efficient than standard ones while retaining many of the advantages of provable security. We illustrate these gains for problems including encryption, signatures, and zero-knowledge proofs.},

abstract = {In this note, we present new zero-knowledge interactive proofs and arguments for languages in NP. To show that x ε L, with an error probability of at most 2-k, our zero-knowledge proof system requires O(|x|c1)+O(lgc2|x|)k ideal bit commitments, where c1 and c2 depend only on L. This construction is the first in the ideal bit commitment model that achieves large values of k more efficiently than by running  k independent iterations of the base interactive proof system. Under suitable complexity assumptions, we exhibit zero knowledge arguments that require O(lgc|x|kl bits of communication, where c depends only on L, and l is the security parameter for the prover. This is the first construction in which the total amount of communication can be less than that needed to transmit the NP witness. Our protocols are based on efficiently checkable proofs for NP[4].},
